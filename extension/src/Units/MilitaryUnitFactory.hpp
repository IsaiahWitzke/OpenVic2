//someone please help me make a factory for military units

//factory is neccassary for modability. A person should be able to add their
//own military unit into the game.

//this factory should hold a hashed table of empty instances of
//all military units instantiated on first boot up.

//Upon a creation call goes into the hash table and calls the create
//method for appropriate military unit to get an empty copy.
